Adds an one-click real-time mood rating FeelBox to all of your posts. Oh, there is also a widget.

== Description ==

FL3R FeelBox is a plugin that any blogger can use to track the emotional feedback (Fascinated, Happy, Sad, Angry, Bored or Afraid) of an individual blog post or article. The plugin can be configured to automatically appear below all of your posts, just above the comments, or manually placed anywhere you want, with a Wordpress tag or PHP.

FL3R FeelBox can shows statistics of your posts, sorted by user involvement based on the time period or the emotions.

You can choose from various icons style and add your own title above the plugin: in example, classic style, Emoji One style and Korosensei style tribute from anime Assassination Classroom (暗殺教室 Ansatsu kyōshitsu).

It includes a widget to show your readers the most emotional posts or sort it by a particular emotion, or by the past day, week, month or year.
